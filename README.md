This work proposes an incremental Generalized Iterative Closest Point (GICP) based tightly-coupled LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO), iG-LIO, which addresses the challenges of integrating GICP into real-time LIO. The main contributions are as follows.

- The GICP constraints are tightly-coupled IMU constraints in a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation.
- A voxel-based surface covariance estimator (VSCE) is proposed to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the surface covariance estimation. Compared to the kd-tree based methods, VSCE reduces processing time in dense scans while maintaining the accuracy of iG-LIO in sparse and small FOV scans.
- An incremental voxel map is designed to represent the probabilistic models of surrounding environments. Compared to non-incremental methods (e.g., DLIO), it successfully reduces the time cost required for the nearest neighbor search and map management.
- Extensive datasets collected from different FOV LiDARs are adopted to evaluate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed iG-LIO. Even though iG-LIO keeps identical parameters across all datasets, the results show that it is more efficient than Faster-LIO and achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art LIO systems.
